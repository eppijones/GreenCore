# HDR Environment Maps

Place HDR files here for Image-Based Lighting (IBL).

## Recommended HDR

The app is configured to look for:
- `studio_small_08_1k.hdr`

If no HDR is found, a procedural sky/ground gradient environment is used as fallback.

## Recommended HDRIs for Golf

For outdoor putting green feel:
- Outdoor overcast/sunny sky HDRIs work best
- 1K or 2K resolution is sufficient for environment lighting
- Avoid indoor studio HDRIs unless going for a simulator booth look
